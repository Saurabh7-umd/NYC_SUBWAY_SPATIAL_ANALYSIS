## Project Overview
Experience "Subway Surfers," a data-driven adventure where your goal is to investigate the complex network that is the New York City subway system. Our crew navigates the digital rails like subway surfers, utilizing the vast network that is relied upon by 32% of New York City residents for their everyday commute.

Equipped with our digital surfboards, we set out on this adventure with the Hourly subway datasetâ€”a gold mine that reveals the fluctuations in commuter traffic at particular times. It feels like you are experiencing the minute-by-minute rhythmic pulse of the city's heartbeat. Every data point is a station stop, a split second captured in time, eagerly awaiting our team's deciphering of the patterns that make this subway symphony tick.

But we're not simply riding the data waves. The Subway station information provides us with the precise coordinates of all 496 stations, transforming our surfboards into precision instruments for traversing the immense expanse of the metropolis. We're not simply analyzing; we're locating, examining, and revealing the subway network's geographic tapestry.

## Research Questions:
1) Are there significant differences in frequency of use and passenger flow across different subway lines?

2) How does subway ridership in New York City vary between weekdays and weekends across different time periods of the day?

3) Do you predict specific holidays to cause more surges over others? For example, New Year's Eve and Thanksgiving.

4) Which subway route experiences the highest level of crowding with respect to time?
